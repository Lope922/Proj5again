notes of things to improve on

- Days since customers last visit
    - maybe a blog for them to be able to communicate with their clients rather than e-mail
    - I would like to find a rounded meter that shows how close clients are to achieving thier goals.


- Client accounts should allow them to login and see their goals and their workout assignemnts and schedule with personal trainers
TODO this i need to configure the regular expression pattern in the url to display the current users workout goals and progress.


Todos for tomorrow.

try to finalize app and solidify basics that i have established thus far. Make changes to reps and set to allow trainers
to update the values. Do they need to allow nulls now ? Consider this and re work models and template s

read up on unit test and try and write 3 unit tests before presentation

possibly create a clients portion of the app to separate clients from the trainer side of the app

add the bool value for customers that do not have trainers assigned to allow trainers to try and message potential clients
